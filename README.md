First html project - barebones html only website w/ recipes
Intial Goal: Aiming to soldify what I have learned about HTML before moving on to learning CSS.
Post project reflection: I really enjoyed using this project as a way to solidy my knowledge of basic html commands, while also creating a minimally functional website. I feel that I was able to complete this project with minimal hiccups, and without having to look at previous lessons much at all.
